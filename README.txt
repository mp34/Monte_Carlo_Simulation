Monte Carlo Simulation for investing in Stocks
Monte Carlo Simulation is a statistical method applied in financial modeling where the probability of different outcomes in a problem cannot be simply solved due to the interference of a random variable. The simulation relies on the repetition of random samples to achieve numerical results. It can be used to understand the effect of uncertainty and randomness in forecasting models.

Application in Finance : -
* Valuation of options
* Portfolio valuation

Financial modeling
When performing sensitivity analysis in financial modeling, it can be done using Monte Carlo Simulation in Excel. The analysis is performed to test the impact on the net present value (NPV) of the business as underlying assumptions and variables change.
